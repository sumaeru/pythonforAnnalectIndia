Key things.

1. before coding do understand architecture.
2. apply basics of functions and variables what we discussed..
3. models are the most important in the project.. so recognize them while working on the project.
4. dont write poems
5. get the service, model and database part working. so that we are clear what is input and output of a function we are writing a web   service for.
6. in http..ie web service, while you are writing, put your energy on
          1. are you able to read input from the request.
          2. if you send hardcoded data does it reach the client.
          3. if validations have to be done do it now itself.
 7. then link the http part + service and db part which we wrote at step 5.
 8. how database is connected, what framework for json.. dont go to google find out from the project team.
 9. know the folder structure the project team follows and see what all information is configured..
 10. read from official websites first before we think of freaky ones..
